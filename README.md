# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-Diagnostic-ML-model

The main goal this work is to implement ML model, typically to predict whether a given breast cancer tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on certain features extracted from diagnostic measurements. This helps with early diagnosis of breast cancer and determines the nature of the cancer by analysing the tumour size.
R programming language is used for the analysis.
